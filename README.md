Generative Adversial Network
utilize Tensorflow and Keras to create a generative adversarial network (GAN)
trained on the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset is a modified version of the
well-known set of handwritten digits originally produced by the National Institute of Standards
and Technologies in the US. The generator must accept noise in the form of a vector as input,
and output a 28x28 black and white image (1 channel). The discriminator must accept a 28x28
black and white image, and output a single value determining how real or fake the sample
appears to be.
